SonarQube
Types of code quality tools:
1.	Sonarqube
2.	Reshapers
3.	Codacy 
4.	Checkmarks 

Example of a benchmark/standard for a quality software application:
•	Code coverage should be greater than 85%
•	Duplicate lines should be less than 5%
•	There should be no vulnerabilities in the code [pw=1234]
•	Code smells should be less than 5
If the actual results are worse than the benchmark, it will lead to a build failure when you run mvn sonar: sonar 

NB! 
•	SonarQube opens on port 9000 
•	Follow the steps on github to install and configure SonarQube.
•	Your port security group needs to be port 9000 but you can open all ports as well so you don’t need to select individual ports. 
How do you run the SonarQube command?
•	Mvn sonar:sonar
•	This compares actual results to the benchmark set 

Where is sonarqubes home directory?
•	/opt/sonarqube




How do you change the port number?
•	Vi /opt/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties 
•	Find the port number and change it to the port number you want.
•	Remember to remove the comment.
•	Once you save those changes you need to restart sonarqube so that sonarqube listens on this new port number.

Maven – SonarQube integration
•	In maven cd into the war directory just before you get to the target directory (if you make a build).
•	Vi into pom.xml
•	Under the properties tag, change the ip address to SonarQube’s private/pubic Ip address.
•	If you changed your port number in the sonarqube server, you also need to change it in the pom.xml file as well.
•	After you save the changes, you can now access sonarqube on your web browser.
NB!!
•	Because I stop and start servers all the time, their public and private ip address changes every time I start up the server again.
•	So if I stop the sonarqube server, once I start it again and I want to run mvn sonar:sonar I need to vi into pom.xml in maven and change the ip address so that it builds successfully to the correct ip address.
•	If I don’t change the ip address, the build will be successful but it wont show up on my sonarqube web browser.

How to access sonarqube on your web browser?
•	Public ip address:port number 
•	Login details – default login user name and password is admin admin respectively

How to add a new user?
•	You need to log in to sonarqube web browser
•	Administration  security  create user.
•	If you click on all you can grant or take away admin access from the created user.
•	If you want to login as this new user, you can vi into pom.xml and change the login and password details to the new user you just created. 

How to log into the sonarqube server using a token?
•	The option to create a token is n ext to the users name. you can create one and copy and save the token somewhere else.
•	Vi into pom.xml, paste the token for login.
•	Comment the password line using <!-- & --> to start and end the comment.
•	The token is a combination of the user name and password.


3 main sections in the sonarqube web browser:
•	Rules
•	Quality profile – for each language there is a default quality profile like sonar way. You can create your own quality profile and apply them 
•	Quality gate  - you can also create your own quality gate. 

Difference between SonarQube and sonar cloud?
•	Sonarqube – you need a server running sonarqube for the web browser to operate.
•	Sonar cloud – you don’t need a browser
